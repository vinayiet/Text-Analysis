Check: We have usedlanguage tool pythonfor this ,LanguageToolis an open-source grammar tool, also known as the spellchecker for OpenOffice. This library allows you to detect grammar errors and spelling mistakes through a Python script or through a command-line interface. Sentimental Analysis: For Sentimental Analysis we used FLAIR, Flair is a pre-trained embedding-based model. This means that each word is represented inside a vector space. Words with vector representations most similar to another word are often used in the same context. This allows us, to, therefore, determine the sentiment of any given vector, and therefore, any given sentence. Keywords Extraction:For keywords extraction we usedSPACYwhich is newer than NLTK or Scikit-Learn, is aimed at making deep learning for text data analysis as simple as possible. The following are the procedures involved in extracting keywords from a text using spacy. Split the input text content by tokens Extract the hot words from the token list.Set the hot words as the words with pos tag “PROPN“, “ADJ“, or “NOUN“.

grammar tool, also known as the spellchecker for OpenOffice. This library allows you to detect grammar errors and spelling mistakes through a Python script or through a command-line interface.Sentimental Analysis: For Sentimental Analysis we used FLAIR, Flair is a pre-trained embedding-based model. This means that each word is represented inside a vector space. Words with vector representations most similar to another word are often used in the same context. This allows us, to, therefore, determine the sentiment of any given vector, and therefore, any given sentence.Keywords Extraction:For keywords extraction we usedSPACYwhich is newer than NLTK or Scikit-Learn, is aimed at making deep learning for text data analysis as simple as possible. The following are the procedures involved in extracting keywords from a text using spacy.Split the input text content by tokensExtract the hot words from the token list.Set the hot words as the words with pos tag “PROPN“, “ADJ“, or “NOUN“.
