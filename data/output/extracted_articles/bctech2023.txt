Code Review Checklist Client:A leading tech firm in the USA Industry Type:IT Products & Services:IT & Consulting, Software Development, DevOps Organization Size:100+ The client requires a Grafana dashboard that can fetch data from a web API providing historical data of building automation systems. The dashboard needs to allow manual entry of a target URL for individual buildings, selection of a history name from a dropdown or search bar, selectable time range for displaying history data, and the ability to choose from various chart types for visualization. Additionally, the client wants to set up alarms for certain metrics like CPU, RAM, and hard disk usage. Each user should only be able to view their own STier API data, which is controlled by their IP. To meet these requirements, we will set up a Grafana dashboard using the Grafana API. We will configure the dashboard to connect to the web API and fetch data based on the user’s input for the target URL, history name, and time range. For visualization, we will implement various chart types including Bar, Line, and Scatter plot charts. To set up alarms for specific metrics, we will utilize Grafana’s built-in alerting feature.  The proposed Grafana dashboard will significantly enhance the business’s ability to monitor and manage building automation systems. By providing real-time data visualization and the ability to set alarms for specific metrics, the business can quickly identify and address potential issues, ensuring optimal system performance and efficiency. Furthermore, the user-specific permissions will ensure that sensitive data remains secure and accessible only to authorized individuals. This will not only streamline operations but also boost confidence among staff members who can now make informed decisions based on accurate and timely data. The dashboard’s flexibility in terms of selectable history names and time ranges will allow for comprehensive analysis of historical data, leading to improved decision-making processes. Overall, this solution will contribute to increased operational efficiency, reduced downtime, and improved customer satisfaction by ensuring smooth operation of building automation systems. https://mailhvac.postman.co/workspace/Team-Workspace~902b44a6-966b-4e59-8400-3ae02c12ce6b/collection/17767455-eb2c775e-421d-4f7c-9ec5-b4f6a73f1a5a?action=share&creator=17767455 Summarized: https://blackcoffer.com/ This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.

Services:IT & Consulting, Software Development, DevOpsOrganization Size:100+The ProblemThe client requires a Grafana dashboard that can fetch data from a web API providing historical data of building automation systems. The dashboard needs to allow manual entry of a target URL for individual buildings, selection of a history name from a dropdown or search bar, selectable time range for displaying history data, and the ability to choose from various chart types for visualization. Additionally, the client wants to set up alarms for certain metrics like CPU, RAM, and hard disk usage. Each user should only be able to view their own STier API data, which is controlled by their IP.Our SolutionTo meet these requirements, we will set up a Grafana dashboard using the Grafana API. We will configure the dashboard to connect to the web API and fetch data based on the user’s input for the target URL, history name, and time range. For visualization, we will implement various chart types including Bar, Line, and Scatter plot charts. To set up alarms for specific metrics, we will utilize Grafana’s built-in alerting feature.Solution ArchitectureDeliverablesA fully functional Grafana dashboard connected to the web APIAbility to manually enter a target URL for individual buildingsSelection of history name from a dropdown or search barSelection of time range for displaying history dataVarious chart types for data visualizationSetup of alarms for specific metricsTech StackTools usedPythonGrafanaGrafana APIWeb API for historical data of building automation systemsLanguage/techniques usedJavascriptSQLSkills usedData VisualizationAPI IntegrationUser Interface DesignDatabases usedGrafana DatabaseWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionImplementing user permissions for individual usersSetting up alarms for specific metricsHow the Technical Challenges were SolvedFor connecting Grafana to the web API, we used the Grafana API and configured it to fetch data from the web API based on user input.To implement user permissions, we used Grafana’s built-in user management feature and set up roles and permissions accordingly.For setting up alarms, we leveraged Grafana’s built-in alerting feature and configured it to trigger alerts based on specific conditions.Business ImpactThe proposed Grafana dashboard will significantly enhance the business’s ability to monitor and manage building automation systems. By providing real-time data visualization and the ability to set alarms for specific metrics, the business can quickly identify and address potential issues, ensuring optimal system performance and efficiency. Furthermore, the user-specific permissions will ensure that sensitive data remains secure and accessible only to authorized individuals. This will not only streamline operations but also boost confidence among staff members who can now make informed decisions based on accurate and timely data. The dashboard’s flexibility in terms of selectable history names and time ranges will allow for comprehensive analysis of historical data, leading to improved decision-making processes. Overall, this solution will contribute to increased operational efficiency, reduced downtime, and improved customer satisfaction by ensuring smooth operation of building automation systems.Project website urlhttps://mailhvac.postman.co/workspace/Team-Workspace~902b44a6-966b-4e59-8400-3ae02c12ce6b/collection/17767455-eb2c775e-421d-4f7c-9ec5-b4f6a73f1a5a?action=share&creator=17767455SummarizeSummarized: https://blackcoffer.com/This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.Contact DetailsThis solution was designed and developed by Blackcoffer TeamHere are my contact details:Firm Name: Blackcoffer Pvt.
