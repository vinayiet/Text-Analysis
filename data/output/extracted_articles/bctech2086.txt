Code Review Checklist Client:A Leading Tech Firm in the USA Industry Type:IT Consulting Services:Software, Consulting Organization Size:100+ We have given an excel sheet of medical research paper text and provided some phrases to identify research papers that can be used for future medical research. If the phrase is not present in a research paper then it will not be used for research. After annotation, we need to find the best ML/DL model to train research data and evaluate the model on test data. We have created a python script that can compare all medical research paper text to research phrases and annot 0 if research phrases are not present in a medical research paper and 1 if research phrases present in medical research paper. After annotation we have trained different machine learning and deep learning models like Bert base uncased using Tensorflow, bert large, XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression. Among these models we have chosen the best accuracy  parameters model. In our case the bert-base model performed good and gave 95% test accuracy.

Train an ML/DL model on classified data. The research paper has a huge amount of text data so the model was giving space errors in colab notebooks. Find the best threshold value which gives best test accuracy. To solve space error we have trained the model with lower batch size so this solved the error. To find the best threshold value we created the ROC AUC curve and Precision  Recall curve and checked best points where accuracy will be higher.

medical research paper into 0 if the medical research paper cannot be used in future medical research and 1 if the medical research paper can be used in research based on some research-related phrases.Train an ML/DL model on classified data.Project DescriptionWe have given an excel sheet of medical research paper text and provided some phrases to identify research papers that can be used for future medical research. If the phrase is not present in a research paper then it will not be used for research. After annotation, we need to find the best ML/DL model to train research data and evaluate the model on test data.Our SolutionWe have created a python script that can compare all medical research paper text to research phrases and annot 0 if research phrases are not present in a medical research paper and 1 if research phrases present in medical research paper.After annotation we have trained different machine learning and deep learning models like Bert base uncased using Tensorflow, bert large, XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Logistic Regression. Among these models we have chosen the best accuracy  parameters model. In our case the bert-base model performed good and gave 95% test accuracy.Project DeliverablesML/DL model which is trained on medical research classification data to classify other medical research papers.Tools usedGoogle Colab notebooks, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Transformers, MS ExcelLanguage/techniques usedPython, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data Science, Natural Language Processing (NLP).Models usedTensorflow-Bert model, PyTorch LSTM model, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Logistic Regression.Skills usedMachine Learning, Deep learning, NLP, Python programming.Databases usedused ms excel dataWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThere are various technical challenges faced during project execution:The research paper has a huge amount of text data so the model was giving space errors in colab notebooks.Find the best threshold value which gives best test accuracy.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedTo solve space error we have trained the model with lower batch size so this solved the error.To find the best threshold value we created the ROC AUC curve and Precision  Recall curve and checked best points where accuracy will be higher.Previous articleDesign & Develop BERT Question Answering model explanations with visualizationNext articlePlaystore & Appstore to Google Analytics (GA) or Firebase to Google Data Studio Mobile App KPI DashboardAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORHealthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application DevelopmentStreamlined Integration: Interactive Brokers API with Python for Desktop Trading ApplicationMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSA Leading Firm in the USA, SEO and Website OptimizationSeptember 5, 2021AI Conversational Bot using RASAFebruary 19, 2022Sentiment Analysis Bot for Price PredictionMarch 10, 2021Solution to quadratic assignment problems (QAP) using Ant Colony SystemFebruary 18, 2019Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSOTT platform and its impact on the entertainment industry in Future.Marketing, sales, and financial data business dashboard (Wink Report)Are we any closer to preventing a nuclear holocaust?Sentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies Client BackgroundClient:A Leading Tech Firm in the USAIndustry Type:IT ConsultingServices:Software, ConsultingOrganization Size:100+Project ObjectiveClassify the medical research paper into 0 if the medical research paper cannot be used in future medical research and 1 if the medical research paper can be used in research based on some research-related phrases.Train an ML/DL model on classified data.Project DescriptionWe have given an excel sheet of medical research paper text and provided some phrases to identify research papers that can be used for future medical research.
