They want to see the leadership dashboard of their organization in terms of sales. They also want to keep track of their campaigns and leads generated from sources of those campaigns. They want to keep track of sales data from different sources.Our SolutionFirst, we fetch the data from CRM to PowerBI. Clean the data of CRM using DAX and then perform calculations on the data.

We used Zapier. It is connector between two applications so that whenever a particular incident happen it will populate into another application. We use Zapier to connect CRM and Google sheets so that whenever a new lead will change or modified data will be stored into google sheets.Data in google sheets was uncleaned. First, we connect the Google sheet with PowerbI then perform EDA to clean the data using DAX language.Using merging of two tables by ONE-ON-ONE schema we solve duplicate entries of a particular lead in PowerBI.Business ImpactUsing this Dashboard client can make important decisions like from which campaign they are getting a greater number of leads and out of those leads how many are actually a Sale.
