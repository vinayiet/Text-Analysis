With Drive lah you can reduce the cost of ownership by renting it out when you don’t need it in a safe way. Renters can rent those cars when they are not used by their owners at good value.In a fast-growing non-ownership economy where taxi, food, beauty is available on-demand, Drive lah is envisioning to take the lead in distance travel and simplifying car access Websitehttp://www.drivelah.sgCompany size11-50 employeesFounded2019 Automating the process to get updated Metrics every week.
