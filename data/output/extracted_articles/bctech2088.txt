Code Review Checklist Client:A Leading Tech Firm in the USA Industry Type:IT Consulting Services:Software, Consulting Organization Size:100+ We need to create a notebook with solutions to binary classification-related anomaly detection problems. We need to use machine learning and deep learning models which have greater than 90% accuracy. We created a notebook for anomaly detection. We used 10 to 15 machine learning and deep learning models but only  3 different types of auto encoder models that were giving greater than 90% accuracy. We trained all 3 models on one classification data which have anomalies and evaluated trained models on test data. A notebook that has solutions for anomaly detection related classification problems and accuracy should be above 90%. Google colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Google drive Python programming language, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data analysis and Data visualization. Auto Encoder and Variational Auto Encoder Python, Data Analysis, Data visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning. MS Excel We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

work with regression type data and this problem was classification problem so we need to deal with classification data. Getting high accuracy is also a tough challenge for us because there are only a few models which work well on anomaly detection related classification problems. So we have limited models for this problem so we used only classification models like Autoencoders, Isolation forest and one class svm. Only Autoencoder was giving high accuracy so we worked with different types of autoencoders like variational autoencoder and normal autoencoder.

BackgroundClient:A Leading Tech Firm in the USAIndustry Type:IT ConsultingServices:Software, ConsultingOrganization Size:100+Project DescriptionWe need to create a notebook with solutions to binary classification-related anomaly detection problems. We need to use machine learning and deep learning models which have greater than 90% accuracy.Our SolutionWe created a notebook for anomaly detection. We used 10 to 15 machine learning and deep learning models but only  3 different types of auto encoder models that were giving greater than 90% accuracy. We trained all 3 models on one classification data which have anomalies and evaluated trained models on test data.Project DeliverablesA notebook that has solutions for anomaly detection related classification problems and accuracy should be above 90%.Tools usedGoogle colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Google driveLanguage/techniques usedPython programming language, Machine learning, Deep learning, Data analysis and Data visualization.Models usedAuto Encoder and Variational Auto EncoderSkills usedPython, Data Analysis, Data visualization, Machine learning, Deep learning.Databases usedMS ExcelWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionMost of the anomaly detection models work with regression type data and this problem was classification problem so we need to deal with classification data.Getting high accuracy is also a tough challenge for us because there are only a few models which work well on anomaly detection related classification problems.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedSo we have limited models for this problem so we used only classification models like Autoencoders, Isolation forest and one class svm.Only Autoencoder was giving high accuracy so we worked with different types of autoencoders like variational autoencoder and normal autoencoder.Project SnapshotsPrevious articleAn ETL Solution for Currency Data to Google Big QueryNext articleDesign & Develop BERT Question Answering model explanations with visualizationAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORHealthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainAI Bot Audio to audioEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application DevelopmentMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSThe 8 Steps of AI/ML ProjectJanuary 14, 2020Data Management – EGEASAugust 6, 2023Grafana Dashboard – Oscar AwardsJuly 8, 2023What is Data Exfiltration?May 14, 2017Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSELK Stack – Elastic QueriesAn ETL Solution for Currency Data to Google Big QueryHow Voice search makes your business a successful business.Power BI Dashboard on Operations, Transactions, and Marketing Data, embedding the...
