Code Review Checklist Client:A leading research institution in the middle east Industry Type:Research Services:R&D Organization Size:1000+ To complete a Research Paper draft by training various Machine Learning models which can predict the Incident Duration based on various parameters given in the dataset and summarising the results. Given a set of researches, need to analyse and compare various machine learning and deep learning models to predict the Incident Duration for the given dataset. The dataset contained Short durations as well as Long durations. Build models for each set of durations, compare and get the best out of all. Here, we had to predict the traffic incident duration with some machine learning tools and techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR and Deep Learning algorithm using tensor flow. First two models were run on Python Interpreter whereas Deep learning model was run on R studio, all the three with the same dataset and then we had compared these models based on their MAE (mean absolute error). Initially, we had done a preliminary analysis of the collected incident duration data, to collect the statistical characteristics of all the variables used in our research. Python Interpreter Language Used: Python Libraries Used: pandas, sklearn, numpy, keras, pickle Programming, Statistical Analysis We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Type:ResearchServices:R&DOrganization Size:1000+Project ObjectiveTo complete a Research Paper draft by training various Machine Learning models which can predict the Incident Duration based on various parameters given in the dataset and summarising the results.Project DescriptionGiven a set of researches, need to analyse and compare various machine learning and deep learning models to predict the Incident Duration for the given dataset. The dataset contained Short durations as well as Long durations. Build models for each set of durations, compare and get the best out of all.Our SolutionHere, we had to predict the traffic incident duration with some machine learning tools and techniques i.e. XGBoost, SVR and Deep Learning algorithm using tensor flow. First two models were run on Python Interpreter whereas Deep learning model was run on R studio, all the three with the same dataset and then we had compared these models based on their MAE (mean absolute error). Initially, we had done a preliminary analysis of the collected incident duration data, to collect the statistical characteristics of all the variables used in our research.Project DeliverablesPython Script for each model.Documentation for Research Work.Tools usedPython InterpreterLanguage/techniques usedLanguage Used: PythonLibraries Used: pandas, sklearn, numpy, keras, pickleModels usedXGBRegressorSVRSGDRegressorSequentialDecisionTreeRegressorSkills usedProgramming, Statistical AnalysisProject SnapshotsPrevious articleStatistical Data Analysis of Reinforced ConcreteNext articleHow does Metaverse work in the Financial sector?Ajay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOREfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application DevelopmentStreamlined Integration: Interactive Brokers API with Python for Desktop Trading ApplicationEfficient Data Integration and User-Friendly Interface Development: Navigating Challenges in Web Application DeploymentMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSImpact of COVID-19 pandemic on Tourism & Aviation industriesJune 22, 2020Methodology for database discovery tool using openai, LLMA, LangchainFebruary 27, 2024A web-based dashboard for the filtered data retrieval of land recordsSeptember 15, 2022Future of AI and Machine Roles in the Medical SectorJune 26, 2021Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSDesign and develop a retool app that will show stock and...Design and develop MLops framework for Data-centric AIHow to increase social media engagement for marketers?How prepared is India to tackle a possible COVID-19 outbreak?
