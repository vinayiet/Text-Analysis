Code Review Checklist Client:A leading research institution in the middle east Industry Type:Research Services:R&D Organization Size:1000+  Conducting statistical data analysis on the data provided for different types of reinforced concrete (using 3 different fibers – Steel, Date Palm and Polypropylene fibers) and also helping in preparing good research paper based on laboratory data. The project had two phase: Phase 1: In this phase, we had to do a comprehensive analysis on the data given and finally build statistical models for the variables present. The main motive was to understand the behaviour of concrete based on various parameters – Compressive strength, Flexural strength, water absorption capabilities of the concrete and many more. The analysis should include, but was not limited to: Phase 2: In this phase, we had to develop a structure for the research paper based on the results and analysis. The paper included sections – Abstract, Introduction ( literature, background and objective), Experimental program ( materials and methods), Results and discussion ( analysis and interpretation) and Conclusion ( summary, insights and remarks). Providing a Comprehensive analysis for the concrete data – showcasing the key insights from it based on the parameters (compressive strength, etc). On the basis of results from the analysis, research paper was drafted which included all the deliverable. A manuscript (drafted article) with the following: Tools used: Statistical models – linear, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic models build for showcasing behavior of concrete mixes due to mixing of different fiber content and its effect on different parameters specified above. Coding – Python Performing statistical analysis – extracting inferences Building statistical models – through python or through Excel and its counterparts. No database was used. No Cloud server was used. The Challenges faced during project execution are: I had to use different libraries for building the models, later on turned to MS excel and spreadsheet because they were building models and were also able to showcase it on the data itself. For this, I learned how to build models on the aforementioned software through YouTube and blogs. We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Client BackgroundClient:A leading research institution in the middle eastIndustry Type:ResearchServices:R&DOrganization Size:1000+Project ObjectiveConducting statistical data analysis on the data provided for different types of reinforced concrete (using 3 different fibers – Steel, Date Palm and Polypropylene fibers) and also helping in preparing good research paper based on laboratory data.Project DescriptionThe project had two phase:Phase 1:In this phase, we had to do a comprehensive analysis on the data given and finally build statistical models for the variables present. The main motive was to understand the behaviour of concrete based on various parameters – Compressive strength, Flexural strength, water absorption capabilities of the concrete and many more. The analysis should include, but was not limited to:Comparison of Mo (control mix) with all mixes at 28 days for each parameter testComparing all parameters for all specimens (all concrete mixes) with 28 days and also 6 months heat-cool and wet-dryall other expected analysis we could see you and doPhase 2:In this phase, we had to develop a structure for the research paper based on the results and analysis. The paper included sections – Abstract, Introduction ( literature, background and objective), Experimental program ( materials and methods), Results and discussion ( analysis and interpretation) and Conclusion ( summary, insights and remarks).Our SolutionProviding a Comprehensive analysis for the concrete data – showcasing the key insights from it based on the parameters (compressive strength, etc). On the basis of results from the analysis, research paper was drafted which included all the deliverable.Project DeliverableA manuscript (drafted article) with the following:AbstractIntroduction ( literature, background and objective)Experimental program ( materials and methods)Results and discussion ( analysis and interpretation)Conclusion ( summary, insights and remarks)ReferencesTools usedTools used:Jupyter – Notbebook (Python)NumpyPandasSklearnMatplotlibSeabornMS ExcelGoogle spreadsheetsLanguage/techniques usedPythonStatistical ModellingStatistical InferenceModels usedStatistical models – linear, polynomial, exponential and logarithmic models build for showcasing behavior of concrete mixes due to mixing of different fiber content and its effect on different parameters specified above.Skills usedCoding – PythonPerforming statistical analysis – extracting inferencesBuilding statistical models – through python or through Excel and its counterparts.Databases usedNo database was used.Web Cloud Servers usedNo Cloud server was used.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe Challenges faced during project execution are:Getting statistical models from seaborn libraries, there is no direct way to get the models from the graphs created from data.Building models in excel and validating it (didn’t know how, had to learn it before applying it).How the Technical Challenges were SolvedI had to use different libraries for building the models, later on turned to MS excel and spreadsheet because they were building models and were also able to showcase it on the data itself. For this, I learned how to build models on the aforementioned software through YouTube and blogs.Project SnapshotsProject VideoPrevious articleDatabase Normalization & Segmentation with Google Data Studio Dashboard InsightsNext articleIncident Duration Prediction – Infrastructure and Real EstateAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORHealthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainAI Bot Audio to audioEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application DevelopmentMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSWill machine replace the human in the future of work?June 24, 2021AI, ML, and IoT driven Entry Management and MonitoringJune 19, 2020Advanced AI for Road Cam Threat DetectionJuly 22, 2023Impact of Indian Economy due to COVID-19April 12, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSAre Initial Big Data Efforts Focused on Gaining Insights from Existing...How the COVID-19 crisis is redefining jobs and services?The Future of Telehealth ServicesBig Data & Analytics to Help Voters Know Their Political Leaders Client BackgroundClient:A leading research institution in the middle eastIndustry Type:ResearchServices:R&DOrganization Size:1000+Project ObjectiveConducting statistical data analysis on the data provided for different types of reinforced concrete (using 3 different fibers – Steel, Date Palm and Polypropylene fibers) and also helping in preparing good research paper based on laboratory data.Project DescriptionThe project had two phase:Phase 1:In this phase, we had to do a comprehensive analysis on the data given and finally build statistical models for the variables present.
