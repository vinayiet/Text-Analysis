Code Review Checklist Client:A leading marketing firm in the USA Industry Type:Marketing services & Consulting Services:Marketing consultant Organization Size:100+ Project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ objective were to perform Data Abstraction, Data Structurization, Data Preprocessing, Data Cleaning, and Combining Data from all the years listed and finally presenting insights of the data by Exploratory Data Analysis. For Project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ task involved fetching json and unformatted csv data from numerous web links further needed to process data, handling nested JSON, data conversion of JSON data in dataframe, performing certain pandas operation for feature selection and structuring data. Concat all this data into one csv file then handle missing value by mapping with another dataset finally perform certain data visualization and exploratory data analysis. Module 1: Data Abstraction The process of data abstraction involves collecting data from numerous web links from Year 2005 to 2017 and viewing the data using JSON viewer in tree format. Module 2: Data Chunking and Integration Was unable to process data in pandas so performed data chunking with chunksize 10000 rows at a time for year 2005 likewise performed for all other years data till 2017 and finally combined all the dataframes into one containing all data from year 2005 to 2017. Module 3: Handling Complexity of Nested Data & format the Unformatted CSV Files Handling unformatted CSV in proper comma separated format so that data frame can be formed. Dataframe produced after merging for all the years from 2005 to 2017 contains a lot of nested JSON data among certain attributes so performed normalization of nested Json forming new_columns naming them based on their attributes key. 2.2.4 Module 4: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Involves handling missing value, contraction mapping with another dataset to fill the missing State_Zip_Code column, handling inf and -inf within the dataset for some attributes and forming a new column population_ratio based on passing formula among other attributes. 2.2.5 Module 5: Data Analysis This step involves forming a correlation matrix to understand the relation between numeric attributes. performed Exploratory Data Analysis on strong correlated attributes to understand pattern/relation between them. After completion of Project we provided: ● Jupyter Notebook ● Anaconda ● Notepad++ ● Sublime Text ● Brackets ● Python 3.4 ● JSON Viewer ● Python ● ETL Techniques ● Advanced Excel Formatting My project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ developed with a software model which makes the project high quality, reliable and cost effective. ● Software Model : RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model ● This Project follows a RAD Model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start, also my project was based on prototyping without any specific planning. In the RAD model, there is less attention paid to the planning and more priority is given to the development tasks. It targets developing software in a short span of time. ● Advantages of RAD Model: o Changing requirements can be accommodated. o Progress can be measured. o Iteration time can be short with use of powerful RAD tools. o Productivity with fewer people in a short time. o Reduced development time. o Increases reusability of components. o Quick initial reviews occur. o Encourages customer feedback. o Integration from very beginning solves a lot of integration issues No Database is used in this project, only used Google Drive for Storing and Transferring Data. No Web Server is Used Data Cleaning and Filling out Missing Values by Data mapping with another dataset as the Data was not in proper format in the another dataset. Data Cleaning was done using a few built in pandas operations to deal with Missing Values, Ordering Data Columns, Data Formatting, Changing of data types and many more. Filling of remaining Missing Data from columns using Outer Join among the datasets and using Map Function of Python. Figure 1: Input Data Schema for Year 2008 Figure 2: Output Data Schema from Year 2005 to 2017 Figure 3: Dataset for Year 2008 figure 3 is pandas dataset of year 2008 which has 169595 rows and 25 columns which was fetched from authenticated survey web portal, data obtained were in JSON format which were converted into pandas dataframe likewise there are dataframes created from year 2005 to 2017. Figure 4:  Output Preprocessed Dataset figure 4 is an output preprocessed dataset from 2005 to 2017 which has 26,41,363 rows and 25 columns. Figure 5: Describing Numeric Data of Preprocessed Dataset Figure 6: Bar plot of attribute state_name figure 6 represents the bar plot among the state_name on the final output dataset from year 2005 till 2017. Figure 7: KDE Graph for all numeric population data column of dataset figure 7 represents the Kernel Density Estimate Plot(KDE) among all Population estimate data columns for the Preprocessed Dataset. KDE plot is a method for visualizing the distribution of observations in a dataset, analogous to a histogram. KDE represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions. Plotted many more graphs apart this between highly correlated attributes like pair plot, box plot, line plot etc. Figure 8: Flow Chart We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

20212935 Client BackgroundClient:A leading marketing firm in the USAIndustry Type:Marketing services & ConsultingServices:Marketing consultantOrganization Size:100+Project ObjectiveProject ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ objective were to perform Data Abstraction, Data Structurization, Data Preprocessing, Data Cleaning, and Combining Data from all the years listed and finally presenting insights of the data by Exploratory Data Analysis.Project DescriptionFor Project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ task involved fetching json and unformatted csv data from numerous web links further needed to process data, handling nested JSON, data conversion of JSON data in dataframe, performing certain pandas operation for feature selection and structuring data. Concat all this data into one csv file then handle missing value by mapping with another dataset finally perform certain data visualization and exploratory data analysis.Our SolutionModule 1: Data AbstractionThe process of data abstraction involves collecting data from numerous web links from Year 2005 to 2017 and viewing the data using JSON viewer in tree format.Module 2: Data Chunking and IntegrationWas unable to process data in pandas so performed data chunking with chunksize 10000 rows at a time for year 2005 likewise performed for all other years data till 2017 and finally combined all the dataframes into one containing all data from year 2005 to 2017.Module 3: Handling Complexity of Nested Data & format the Unformatted CSV FilesHandling unformatted CSV in proper comma separated format so that data frame can be formed. Dataframe produced after merging for all the years from 2005 to 2017 contains a lot of nested JSON data among certain attributes so performed normalization of nested Json forming new_columns naming them based on their attributes key.2.2.4 Module 4: Data Cleaning and PreprocessingInvolves handling missing value, contraction mapping with another dataset to fill the missing State_Zip_Code column, handling inf and -inf within the dataset for some attributes and forming a new column population_ratio based on passing formula among other attributes.2.2.5 Module 5: Data AnalysisThis step involves forming a correlation matrix to understand the relation between numeric attributes. performed Exploratory Data Analysis on strong correlated attributes to understand pattern/relation between them.Project DeliverablesAfter completion of Project we provided:Final Preprocessed CSV FilesThree iPython files:Preprocessed dataset from year 2010 to 2015Preprocessed dataset from year 2008 to 2017Data Visualization and EDA.Tools used● Jupyter Notebook● Anaconda● Notepad++● Sublime Text● Brackets● Python 3.4● JSON ViewerLanguage/techniques used● Python● ETL Techniques● Advanced Excel FormattingModels usedMy project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ developed with a software model which makes the project high quality, reliable and cost effective.● Software Model : RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model● This Project follows a RAD Model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start, also my project was based on prototyping without any specific planning. In the RAD model, there is less attention paid to the planning and more priority is given to the development tasks. It targets developing software in a short span of time.● Advantages of RAD Model:o Changing requirements can be accommodated.o Progress can be measured.o Iteration time can be short with use of powerful RAD tools.o Productivity with fewer people in a short time.o Reduced development time.o Increases reusability of components.o Quick initial reviews occur.o Encourages customer feedback.o Integration from very beginning solves a lot of integration issuesSkills usedPandas OperationsData Chunking and IntegrationData VisualizationExploratory Data AnalysisDatabases usedNo Database is used in this project, only used Google Drive for Storing and Transferring Data.Web Cloud Servers usedNo Web Server is UsedWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionData Cleaning and Filling out Missing Values by Data mapping with another dataset as the Data was not in proper format in the another dataset.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedData Cleaning was done using a few built in pandas operations to deal with Missing Values, Ordering Data Columns, Data Formatting, Changing of data types and many more. Filling of remaining Missing Data from columns using Outer Join among the datasets and using Map Function of Python.Project SnapshotsFigure 1: Input Data Schema for Year 2008Figure 2: Output Data Schema from Year 2005 to 2017Figure 3: Dataset for Year 2008figure 3 is pandas dataset of year 2008 which has 169595 rows and 25 columns which was fetched from authenticated survey web portal, data obtained were in JSON format which were converted into pandas dataframe likewise there are dataframes created from year 2005 to 2017.Figure 4:  Output Preprocessed Datasetfigure 4 is an output preprocessed dataset from 2005 to 2017 which has 26,41,363 rows and 25 columns.Figure 5: Describing Numeric Data of Preprocessed DatasetFigure 6: Bar plot of attribute state_namefigure 6 represents the bar plot among the state_name on the final output dataset from year 2005 till 2017.Figure 7: KDE Graph for all numeric population data column of datasetfigure 7 represents the Kernel Density Estimate Plot(KDE) among all Population estimate data columns for the Preprocessed Dataset. KDE plot is a method for visualizing the distribution of observations in a dataset, analogous to a histogram. KDE represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions.

Concat all this data into one csv file then handle missing value by mapping with another dataset finally perform certain data visualization and exploratory data analysis.Our SolutionModule 1: Data AbstractionThe process of data abstraction involves collecting data from numerous web links from Year 2005 to 2017 and viewing the data using JSON viewer in tree format.Module 2: Data Chunking and IntegrationWas unable to process data in pandas so performed data chunking with chunksize 10000 rows at a time for year 2005 likewise performed for all other years data till 2017 and finally combined all the dataframes into one containing all data from year 2005 to 2017.Module 3: Handling Complexity of Nested Data & format the Unformatted CSV FilesHandling unformatted CSV in proper comma separated format so that data frame can be formed. Dataframe produced after merging for all the years from 2005 to 2017 contains a lot of nested JSON data among certain attributes so performed normalization of nested Json forming new_columns naming them based on their attributes key.2.2.4 Module 4: Data Cleaning and PreprocessingInvolves handling missing value, contraction mapping with another dataset to fill the missing State_Zip_Code column, handling inf and -inf within the dataset for some attributes and forming a new column population_ratio based on passing formula among other attributes.2.2.5 Module 5: Data AnalysisThis step involves forming a correlation matrix to understand the relation between numeric attributes. performed Exploratory Data Analysis on strong correlated attributes to understand pattern/relation between them.Project DeliverablesAfter completion of Project we provided:Final Preprocessed CSV FilesThree iPython files:Preprocessed dataset from year 2010 to 2015Preprocessed dataset from year 2008 to 2017Data Visualization and EDA.Tools used● Jupyter Notebook● Anaconda● Notepad++● Sublime Text● Brackets● Python 3.4● JSON ViewerLanguage/techniques used● Python● ETL Techniques● Advanced Excel FormattingModels usedMy project ‘Population and Community Survey of America’ developed with a software model which makes the project high quality, reliable and cost effective.● Software Model : RAD(Rapid Application Development model) Model● This Project follows a RAD Model as our model is not forming the loop from end to the start, also my project was based on prototyping without any specific planning. In the RAD model, there is less attention paid to the planning and more priority is given to the development tasks. It targets developing software in a short span of time.● Advantages of RAD Model:o Changing requirements can be accommodated.o Progress can be measured.o Iteration time can be short with use of powerful RAD tools.o Productivity with fewer people in a short time.o Reduced development time.o Increases reusability of components.o Quick initial reviews occur.o Encourages customer feedback.o Integration from very beginning solves a lot of integration issuesSkills usedPandas OperationsData Chunking and IntegrationData VisualizationExploratory Data AnalysisDatabases usedNo Database is used in this project, only used Google Drive for Storing and Transferring Data.Web Cloud Servers usedNo Web Server is UsedWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionData Cleaning and Filling out Missing Values by Data mapping with another dataset as the Data was not in proper format in the another dataset.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedData Cleaning was done using a few built in pandas operations to deal with Missing Values, Ordering Data Columns, Data Formatting, Changing of data types and many more. Filling of remaining Missing Data from columns using Outer Join among the datasets and using Map Function of Python.Project SnapshotsFigure 1: Input Data Schema for Year 2008Figure 2: Output Data Schema from Year 2005 to 2017Figure 3: Dataset for Year 2008figure 3 is pandas dataset of year 2008 which has 169595 rows and 25 columns which was fetched from authenticated survey web portal, data obtained were in JSON format which were converted into pandas dataframe likewise there are dataframes created from year 2005 to 2017.Figure 4:  Output Preprocessed Datasetfigure 4 is an output preprocessed dataset from 2005 to 2017 which has 26,41,363 rows and 25 columns.Figure 5: Describing Numeric Data of Preprocessed DatasetFigure 6: Bar plot of attribute state_namefigure 6 represents the bar plot among the state_name on the final output dataset from year 2005 till 2017.Figure 7: KDE Graph for all numeric population data column of datasetfigure 7 represents the Kernel Density Estimate Plot(KDE) among all Population estimate data columns for the Preprocessed Dataset. KDE plot is a method for visualizing the distribution of observations in a dataset, analogous to a histogram. KDE represents the data using a continuous probability density curve in one or more dimensions. Plotted many more graphs apart this between highly correlated attributes like pair plot, box plot, line plot etc.Figure 8: Flow Chart Previous articleGoogle LSA API Data Automation and DashboardingNext articleSentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies Previous articleGoogle LSA API Data Automation and Dashboarding Previous articleGoogle LSA API Data Automation and Dashboarding Next articleSentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies Next articleSentimental Analysis on Shareholder Letter of Companies RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORHealthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainAI Bot Audio to audioEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainAI Bot Audio to audioEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainAI Bot Audio to audioEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain Healthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, Langchain Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development Efficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application Development MOST POPULAR INSIGHTSRecommendation System for Posts and Articles.June 7, 2021How does Big Data Help in Finance and the Growth of...July 19, 2021Budget, Sales KPI Dashboard using Power BIJuly 29, 2021Data Management, ETL, and Data AutomationAugust 6, 2023Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSWill machine replace the human in the future of work?Stocktwits Data StructurizationData Analytics as a Tool to Reduce the Cost of Production...Solution to quadratic assignment problems (QAP) using Ant Colony System MOST POPULAR INSIGHTSRecommendation System for Posts and Articles.June 7, 2021How does Big Data Help in Finance and the Growth of...July 19, 2021Budget, Sales KPI Dashboard using Power BIJuly 29, 2021Data Management, ETL, and Data AutomationAugust 6, 2023Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSWill machine replace the human in the future of work?Stocktwits Data StructurizationData Analytics as a Tool to Reduce the Cost of Production...Solution to quadratic assignment problems (QAP) using Ant Colony System MOST POPULAR INSIGHTSRecommendation System for Posts and Articles.June 7, 2021How does Big Data Help in Finance and the Growth of...July 19, 2021Budget, Sales KPI Dashboard using Power BIJuly 29, 2021Data Management, ETL, and Data AutomationAugust 6, 2023Load more Recommendation System for Posts and Articles.June 7, 2021How does Big Data Help in Finance and the Growth of...July 19, 2021Budget, Sales KPI Dashboard using Power BIJuly 29, 2021Data Management, ETL, and Data AutomationAugust 6, 2023 Recommendation System for Posts and Articles.June 7, 2021 Recommendation System for Posts and Articles.June 7, 2021 Recommendation System for Posts and Articles.June 7, 2021 How does Big Data Help in Finance and the Growth of...July 19, 2021 How does Big Data Help in Finance and the Growth of...July 19, 2021 How does Big Data Help in Finance and the Growth of...July 19, 2021 Budget, Sales KPI Dashboard using Power BIJuly 29, 2021 Budget, Sales KPI Dashboard using Power BIJuly 29, 2021 Budget, Sales KPI Dashboard using Power BIJuly 29, 2021 Data Management, ETL, and Data AutomationAugust 6, 2023 Data Management, ETL, and Data AutomationAugust 6, 2023 Data Management, ETL, and Data AutomationAugust 6, 2023 RECOMMENDED INSIGHTSWill machine replace the human in the future of work?Stocktwits Data StructurizationData Analytics as a Tool to Reduce the Cost of Production...Solution to quadratic assignment problems (QAP) using Ant Colony System Will machine replace the human in the future of work?Stocktwits Data StructurizationData Analytics as a Tool to Reduce the Cost of Production...Solution to quadratic assignment problems (QAP) using Ant Colony System Will machine replace the human in the future of work?Stocktwits Data Structurization Will machine replace the human in the future of work?
