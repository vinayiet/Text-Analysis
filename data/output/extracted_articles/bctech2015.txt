Hedging and Configuration:The application should allow users to hedge positions, configure trading settings, close orders manually, and add new orders. Real-time Monitoring:Real-time monitoring and control of trading activities are crucial for efficient trading. EA Functionality:The specific functionality and rules of the EA will be defined based on pricing and requirements. Display Application:Developed a Windows-based application for trading operations management, order placement, and monitoring. EA Interaction:Created a loosely coupled system where the Display Application can control and influence the EA running on MT4. Functionality:Implemented order placement, hedging, settings configuration, order closing, and real-time monitoring features. Dynamic EA:The EA’s specific rules and functionality are determined based on pricing and requirements. Communication:Established a mechanism for the Display Application to communicate with MT4, facilitating trading instructions and updates. UI Development:UI development using Python libraries such as Kivy and Tkinter for the Windows-based application. VPS with MT4:The client operates a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with MT4 running. Expert Advisor (EA):An EA on MT4 executes trading operations based on predefined rules. Communication:A mechanism for the Display Application to communicate with MT4, possibly through an API or other methods.

activities in MetaTrader 4 (MT4).EA Control and Monitoring:Users need a tool to interact with and monitor the EA running in MT4, which follows predefined rules for trading.Hedging and Configuration:The application should allow users to hedge positions, configure trading settings, close orders manually, and add new orders.Real-time Monitoring:Real-time monitoring and control of trading activities are crucial for efficient trading.EA Functionality:The specific functionality and rules of the EA will be defined based on pricing and requirements.Our SolutionDisplay Application:Developed a Windows-based application for trading operations management, order placement, and monitoring.EA Interaction:Created a loosely coupled system where the Display Application can control and influence the EA running on MT4.Functionality:Implemented order placement, hedging, settings configuration, order closing, and real-time monitoring features.Dynamic EA:The EA’s specific rules and functionality are determined based on pricing and requirements.Communication:Established a mechanism for the Display Application to communicate with MT4, facilitating trading instructions
