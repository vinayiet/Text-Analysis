Then, we made a dashboard for tracking the retention rates of customers and other events that they execute on the app like transfer money, user registration, connect banks. The data for these events was fetched from MixPanel. These dashboards were made using Google Data Studio. We need to deliver dashboards for tracking the ads data from Google and Facebook and to track the events which the users perform on their app and for this data was collected from MixPanel. Following Tools were used for successful execution of the project Code was written to create the pipeline to fetch MixPanel data through mixpanel Api and store it in bigquery. So, the code was written in Python. Following Skills were used to complete the project For storing the data of the project Google Sheets and Google BigQuery were used. Web Cloud server used in this project was Google Cloud Platform. Technical Challenges faced during the execution of the project was to understand how the api of the mixpanel works and how to connect it to Google BiqQuery. Another technical challenge that we faced was to find a free resource to connect the facebook ads data to data studio. To solve the technical challenges we went through the documentation of the mixpanel api to get a understanding of how the things work. Based on that we built the pipeline to connect the mixpanel data to big query. The other technical challenge of finding a free resource to connect the facebook ads to datastudio for free was solved by researching for the various connectors available and we found an add on named ‘Adveronix’ which could connect the facebook ads data to google sheets which can eaily be connected to data studio. https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/8af163c1-b328-4ed3-91fc-cf8a026d0d9f We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

dashboard unifying all the platforms that we use: Google Ads, FB ads, Appsflyer, MixpanelProject DescriptionWe want to be able to track everything in the funnel from traffic source to total installs (paid, organic and by channel):– App settings in Appsflyer– SDK Installation, test it (+ instruction for devs)– Ad sources setup in ad accounts (Facebook, Google Ads, etc)– Ad sources setup in Appsflyer– In-app conversions mapping– Conversion set up in ads sources– One link, smart script, and deep link setup– SKAD Network for IOS appOur SolutionBuilt dashboard for each data source like Google Ads, Facebook Ads for tracking installs, channel spend, cost per install for both Android and IOS.Then, we made a dashboard for tracking the retention rates of customers and other events that they execute on the app like transfer money, user registration, connect banks. The data for these events was fetched from MixPanel.These dashboards were made using Google Data Studio.Project DeliverablesWe need to deliver dashboards for tracking the ads data from Google and Facebook and to track the events which the users perform on their app and for this data was collected from MixPanel.Tools usedFollowing Tools were used for successful execution of the projectGoogle Data StudioAdveronixMixpanel ApiBigQueryGCPLanguage/techniques usedCode was written to create the pipeline to fetch MixPanel data through mixpanel Api and store it in bigquery.

Another technical challenge that we faced was to find a free resource to connect the facebook ads data to data studio.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedTo solve the technical challenges we went through the documentation of the mixpanel api to get a understanding of how the things work. Based on that we built the pipeline to connect the mixpanel data to big query. The other technical challenge of finding a free resource to connect the facebook ads to datastudio for free was solved by researching for the various connectors available and we found an add on named ‘Adveronix’ which could connect the facebook ads data to google sheets which can eaily be connected to data studio.Project SnapshotsProject website urlhttps://datastudio.google.com/reporting/8af163c1-b328-4ed3-91fc-cf8a026d0d9fProject VideoPrevious articleGangala.in: E-commerce Big Data ETL / ELT Solution and Data WarehouseNext articleAWS QuickSight Reporting DashboardAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORHealthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainAI Bot Audio to audioEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application DevelopmentMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSETL PipelineOctober 6, 2019How can Big Data & Analytics change the healthcare sector in...March 15, 2018An ETL tool to pull data from Shiphero to Google Bigquery...July 29, 2023Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on office space and co-working industries.June 18, 2020Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSGrafana Dashboard – Oscar AwardsPolitical Intelligence DatabaseIntegration of a product to a cloud-based CRM platformIs big data the same as AI?
