Code Review Checklist Client:A leading tech firm in Newzealand Industry Type:Retail Services:Retail business Organization Size:100+ Brodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database that he wanted to connect to a Power BI Dashboard. However, ODBC connectors were not working for his level of subscription, so he needed a cheaper workaround. Brodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database containing a large amount of data that he wanted to visualize in a Power BI Dashboard. He initially tried to use ODBC connectors to connect his database to Power BI, but ran into issues due to his level of subscription. We were brought in to help find a cheaper workaround. Our solution involved using Python to extract the relevant data from Brodie’s MongoDB Database. We used the Pandas library to create Dataframes, which we then uploaded to Azure Blob Storage as tables. We set up an Azure pipeline that ran a Python script every 30 minutes to update the tables with new data from the database. We used Brodie’s MongoDB Database keys to extract relevant Data Clusters as Pandas Dataframes. We then added them as tables to Azure Blob Storage and set up a Python script to an Azure pipeline that refreshed every 30 minutes. This allowed us to keep the data in sync and provide Brodie with up-to-date information for his Power BI Dashboard. The final deliverable was a readable CSV file that contained the converted data from the original JSON format. Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Power BI, MongoDB Compass, Microsoft Excel, Azure Blob Storage Python, Pandas, Azure Cloud Storage Python programming, Azure Cloud Storage, data extraction and manipulation MongoDB Database Azure Blob Storage The main challenge we faced was finding a way to connect Brodie’s MongoDB Database to his Power BI Dashboard without using ODBC connectors. We overcame this challenge by using Python and Azure Blob Storage to extract and store the relevant data. Our solution allowed Brodie to visualize his data in a Power BI Dashboard without having to pay for expensive ODBC connectors. The Azure Blob Storage solution we implemented was much more cost-effective and provided him with up-to-date information every 30 minutes. https://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Brodie-Johnco We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

Type:RetailServices:Retail businessOrganization Size:100+Project ObjectiveBrodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database that he wanted to connect to a Power BI Dashboard. However, ODBC connectors were not working for his level of subscription, so he needed a cheaper workaround.Project DescriptionBrodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database containing a large amount of data that he wanted to visualize in a Power BI Dashboard. He initially tried to use ODBC connectors to connect his database to Power BI, but ran into issues due to his level of subscription. We were brought in to help find a cheaper workaround.Our solution involved using Python to extract the relevant data from Brodie’s MongoDB Database. We used the Pandas library to create Dataframes, which we then uploaded to Azure Blob Storage as tables. We set up an Azure pipeline that ran a Python script every 30 minutes to update the tables with new data from the database.Our SolutionWe used Brodie’s MongoDB Database keys to extract relevant Data Clusters as Pandas Dataframes. We then added them as tables to Azure Blob Storage and set up a Python script to an Azure pipeline that refreshed every 30 minutes. This allowed us to keep the data in sync and provide Brodie with up-to-date information for his Power BI Dashboard.Project DeliverablesThe final deliverable was a readable CSV file that contained the converted data from the original JSON format.Tools usedJupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Power BI, MongoDB Compass, Microsoft Excel, Azure Blob StorageLanguage/techniques usedPython, Pandas, Azure Cloud StorageSkills usedPython programming, Azure Cloud Storage, data extraction and manipulationDatabases usedMongoDB DatabaseWeb Cloud Servers usedAzure Blob StorageWhat are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionThe main challenge we faced was finding a way to connect Brodie’s MongoDB Database to his Power BI Dashboard without using ODBC connectors. We overcame this challenge by using Python and Azure Blob Storage to extract and store the relevant data.How the Technical Challenges were SolvedWe solved the issue by using the client’s MongoDB Database keys to extract relevant Data Clusters as Pandas Dataframes. We then added these dataframes as tables to Azure Blob Storage and set the Python script to an Azure pipeline that refreshed every 30 minutes. This allowed the client to access the data in Power BI without the need for ODBC connectors.Business ImpactOur solution allowed Brodie to visualize his data in a Power BI Dashboard without having to pay for expensive ODBC connectors. The Azure Blob Storage solution we implemented was much more cost-effective and provided him with up-to-date information every 30 minutes.Project website urlhttps://github.com/AjayBidyarthy/Brodie-JohncoPrevious articleData TransformationNext articleBuilding a Physics-Informed Neural Network for Circuit EvaluationAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORHealthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainAI Bot Audio to audioEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application DevelopmentMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSCOVID-19 Vs Indian EconomyApril 11, 2020Obstacles to data-driven HealthcareJuly 19, 2019Advanced AI for Pedestrian Crossing SafetyJuly 22, 2023Equity Waterfalls Model-Based SaaS Application for Real Estate SectorJuly 26, 2023Load moreRECOMMENDED INSIGHTSOn-Page SEORealtime Kibana Dashboard for a financial tech firmEfficient Database Design and Management: Streamlining Access and Integration for Partner...Google Data Studio Pipeline with GCP/MySQL Client BackgroundClient:A leading tech firm in NewzealandIndustry Type:RetailServices:Retail businessOrganization Size:100+Project ObjectiveBrodie Johnco had a MongoDB Database that he wanted to connect to a Power BI Dashboard.
