Code Review Checklist Client:A leading hotels chain in the USA Industry Type:Real Estate, Hospitality Services:Hostpitality Organization Size:1000+ To download the data from the servers using Cyberduck on the daily basis and perform data engineering on it. We created a Python Script which performs the task and create property and forward master files, which we deliver to client on weekly basis. Two csv files named property master file and forward master file to be delivered weekly after applying various steps. PyCharm, PowerBi, Cyberduck, Microsoft Excel. Python Programming Language is used to create scripts performing Data Manipulation in different files. SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process. We are using Iterative Waterfall SDLC Model as we have to follow our development of software in phases and we also need feedback on every step of the development of our project so as to keep track of the occurring changes with every step. Figure 1 SDLC Iterative Waterfall Model Skills such as Data Pre-processing, cleaning, and data manipulation are used in this project. We used traditional way of storing the data i.e file systems. Cyberduck, which is a libre server and cloud storage browser for Mac and Windows with support for FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3 etc, was used in this project with Amazon S3 servers. We provide intelligence, accelerate innovation and implement technology with extraordinary breadth and depth global insights into the big data,data-driven dashboards, applications development, and information management for organizations through combining unique, specialist services and high-lvel human expertise.

the server Secondly, From the property master file a new data set was created with the conditions that the Bedrooms from Property file should be 5 or more or Max Guests from Property File should be 16 or more and City from Property File should be Sevierville or Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg. In the forward file only those with status = R were kept and the other data was removed. Finally, forward file was merged with the new data set on ‘Property ID’ i.e., keeping only those forward data with the common ‘Property ID’ and City, Bedrooms, Max Guests columns from the new dataset was added to the forward file. Data to be processed was very big in size, so space complexity was a challenge in this project To solve the space complexity issues, we tried PowerBi, but now time complexity arises. Then we did processing in chunks, by reducing file sizes to avoid memory errors.

hotels chain in the USAIndustry Type:Real Estate, HospitalityServices:HostpitalityOrganization Size:1000+Project ObjectiveTo download the data from the servers using Cyberduck on the daily basis and perform data engineering on it.Project DescriptionFirstly, download the property and forward files from the serverSecondly, From the property master file a new data set was created with the conditions that the Bedrooms from Property file should be 5 or more or Max Guests from Property File should be 16 or more and City from Property File should be Sevierville or Pigeon Forge or Gatlinburg.In the forward file only those with status = R were kept and the other data was removed.Finally, forward file was merged with the new data set on ‘Property ID’ i.e., keeping only those forward data with the common ‘Property ID’ and City, Bedrooms, Max Guests columns from the new dataset was added to the forward file.Our SolutionWe created a Python Script which performs the task and create property and forward master files, which we deliver to client on weekly basis.Project DeliverablesTwo csv files named property master file and forward master file to be delivered weekly after applying various steps.Tools usedPyCharm, PowerBi, Cyberduck, Microsoft Excel.Language/techniques usedPython Programming Language is used to create scripts performing Data Manipulation in different files.Models usedSDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.We are using Iterative Waterfall SDLC Model as we have to follow our development of software in phases and we also need feedback on every step of the development of our project so as to keep track of the occurring changes with every step.Figure 1 SDLC Iterative Waterfall ModelSkills usedSkills such as Data Pre-processing, cleaning, and data manipulation are used in this project.Databases usedWe used traditional way of storing the data i.e file systems.Web Cloud Servers usedCyberduck, which is a libre server and cloud storage browser for Mac and Windows with support for FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3 etc, was used in this project with Amazon S3 servers.What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project Execution?Data to be processed was very big in size, so space complexity was a challenge in this projectHow the Technical Challenges were SolvedTo solve the space complexity issues, we tried PowerBi, but now time complexity arises.Then we did processing in chunks, by reducing file sizes to avoid memory errors.Project Snapshots (Minimum 10 Pictures)Previous articleReal Estate Data WarehouseNext articleAI and ML technologies to Evaluate Learning AssessmentsAjay BidyarthyRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHORHealthcare AI ChatBot using LLAMA, LLM, LangchainAI Bot Audio to audioEfficient Supply Chain Assessment: Overcoming Technical Hurdles for Web Application DevelopmentMOST POPULAR INSIGHTSPortfolio: Website, Dashboard, SaaS Applications, Web AppsJuly 13, 2022How Metaverse and VR can reform work culture?February 28, 2022How Python became the first choice for Data Science.March 4, 2021Should people wear fabric gloves?
